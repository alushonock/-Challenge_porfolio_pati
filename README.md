#  Task 1 Software configuration
## “Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?”
 
Firstly, I take every opportunity to try myself in something new, especially if it is related to computers. I don't get anything right the first time. Most often, even the simplest task causes difficulty. But I like the feeling of euphoria when the task that you have been solving for a long time is finally completed.

Secondly, there are cool guys working in the IT field who have many interests. This is a great opportunity to make new friends.

Thirdly, all my life I dreamed of a husky. This is a social breed. There must be a person with her all the time. Therefore, I would like to work remotely or on a hybrid work schedule.
